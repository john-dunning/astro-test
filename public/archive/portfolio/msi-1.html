      <p class="InitialPara"> <a href="http://www.msinteractive.com/" target="_blank">Moonstone 
        Interactive</a> is a small interactive web and multimedia development 
        firm in Half Moon Bay, California. I worked with them as an interaction design 
        consultant for about seven months.</p>
			
      <p class="BodyPara">Much of that time was spent on a software design project 
        for Agfa. They hired us to completely redesign PhotoWise, the bundled 
        software that enables a digital camera user to download, organize, edit, 
        and print their images. PhotoWise ships with all of Agfa&#146;s cameras 
        and runs on both Windows and MacOS in 6 localized versions.</p>
			
      <p class="BodyPara">In addition to an exhaustive functional specification, we 
	    developed a working prototype of the application. We ran the prototype
		through a series of focus groups and usability tests to verify that our
		design solutions were appropriate to the target market.</p>

      <p class="BodyPara">To the right is a shot of the software displaying thumbnails 
        of some images the user has downloaded. The downloaded pictures are stored 
        in an &#147;envelope,&#148; which represents a folder on their hard drive. 
        A list of available envelopes is visible on the left. Envelopes are in 
        turn contained within &#147;picture boxes,&#148; providing the user with 
        two levels of hierarchy in which to organize their pictures.</p>
			<p class="BodyPara">We chose the envelope metaphor to reflect the way most 
				people work with analog photos: take a roll, drop it off at a photo lab, 
				pick up the envelope of pictures, look at them, and finally stick the 
				envelope in a box somewhere. By automatically putting pictures that are 
				downloaded at the same time into the same envelope, we can provide at 
				least as much organization as people are used to with analog photos without 
				any additional work on their part.</p>
