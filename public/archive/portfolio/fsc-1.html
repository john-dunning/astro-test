			<p class="InitialPara"> For a couple of years I was the art director for 
				a student organization called the Foundation for Student Communication. 
				Three times a year FSC publishes Business Today magazine, a four-color 
				glossy which is mailed to 200,000 juniors and seniors at 100 colleges 
				across the country. </p>
			<p class="BodyPara">Besides producing Business Today, FSC also holds annual 
				national and international Business Tomorrow conferences, which bring 
				together students and business leaders to discuss a particular issue. 
			</p>
			<p class="BodyPara">This booklet, published after the 1990 international 
				conference, was used in fund-raising efforts during the summer to show 
				what the conferences are all about. I designed the conference logos and 
				the overall grid system for the booklets, and also laid out most of the 
				international booklet. </p>
			<p class="BodyPara">As an historical note, the logo was created with Illustrator 
				88. This was back in the dark ages when Illustrator was unable to kern 
				letter pairs. So to adjust the spacing I had to break up the type into 
				separate blocks.</p>
