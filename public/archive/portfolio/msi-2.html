			<p class="InitialPara"> Here the user has clicked the Camera icon to view 
				thumbnails of the pictures that are stored on their camera. The See Pictures 
				button at the top of the screen displays the thumbnails on a filmstrip, 
				to distinguish them from the thumbnails in an envelope.</p>
			<p class="BodyPara">The Save Pictures button downloads the selected pictures 
				(or all of them, if there&#146;s no selection) from the camera. The pictures 
				are saved in an automatically created envelope. By default, this new envelope 
				is named with the date on which the first picture inside it was taken. 
				Each downloaded image is named with the date and time at which it was 
				taken, e.g., &#147;Apr 4 1999, 7.23.42 PM.jpg&#148;. This provides a much 
				more useful name than &#147;Image01.jpg&#148;, which is how the previous 
				version of the software named pictures.</p>
			<p class="BodyPara">The Save Pictures button was originally called Get Pictures, 
				but in usability testing we found that users were more confident that 
				their pictures had actually been saved to their disk if they clicked something 
				that said &#147;Save.&#148; (No doubt this reaction was due to the bitter 
				experience of losing unsaved work in crashes.)</p>
			<p class="BodyPara">The Pictures, Collections, and Sources tabs on the left 
				work similarly to the icon bar in Outlook. Clicking a tab uncovers 
				it by sliding the others out of the way. Selecting an icon in a tab changes 
				the information that is displayed on the right side of the screen. The 
				buttons along the top also change to reflect the actions that are available 
				for the current items.</p>
			<p class="BodyPara"> The Sources tab contains picture sources besides the 
				camera, such as PC cards or scanners. Since most users will be obtaining 
				pictures solely from their digital camera, the Camera icon is positioned 
				outside of the Sources tab. That way the user can work with just the Camera 
				and the Pictures tab, ignoring the more esoteric sources.</p>
