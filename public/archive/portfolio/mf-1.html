			<p class="InitialPara"> At mFactory I worked on the design of mTropolis, 
				an object-oriented multimedia authoring tool. mTropolis was designed to 
				empower non-programmers to create complex multimedia applications, using 
				a drag-and-drop, icon-based environment. </p>
			
      <p class="BodyPara">The left-most window here displays the hierarchical 
        structure of the user&#146;s project, from the root project level down 
        through sections, subsections, scenes and then to individual elements 
        and modifiers. The structure view works much like the MacOS Finder.</p>
			<p class="BodyPara">Modifiers (the colored icons) can be dropped onto elements 
				(images, movies, sounds, etc.) to provide encapsulated bits of behavior. 
				For example, the screenshot here shows the Drag Motion Modifier dialog. 
				This modifier turns the element that contains it into a draggable object. 
			</p>
			<p class="BodyPara">The popup menu is being used to select a message that 
				will disable the modifier when it receives it. By configuring modifiers 
				to send and receive messages, the user can set up very complex interactions 
				and behaviors.</p>
			
      <p class="BodyPara">As an interface designer I collaborated closely with 
        engineering, documentation, and marketing teams while designing new mTropolis 
        functionality. Another important source of design feedback was our user 
        base. By working with our in-house production team, conducting customer 
        site visits, communicating with our alpha and beta users as well as responding 
        to the mTropolis mailing list, I was able to incorporate our users&#146; 
        goals and needs into the entire development process. </p>
      <p class="BodyPara">When Quark, Inc. purchased mFactory in 1997, I stayed 
        on to finish version 2.0, despite an attitude held by the new owners that 
        might generously be called &#147;benign neglect&#148; (if laying off half 
        the company is benign). When mTropolis 2.0 shipped in March 1998, Quark 
        laid off the remaining diehards and killed the product. Such is life in 
        the Valley.</p>
      <p class="BodyPara">Still, mTropolis lives on. Three years later, a cadre 
        of die-hard users continues to build multimedia presentations with the 
        now unsupported tool. They trade tips and tricks through an <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mtropolis" target="_blank">online 
        forum</a>.</p>
