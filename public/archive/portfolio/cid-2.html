		<p class="InitialPara">The Toro Company&#151;maker of those iconic red lawn mowers&#151;also sells golf course irrigation systems. They asked Cooper to help overhaul their irrigation offerings. While another team undertook a long project to rethink Toro&#146;s irrigation software, I spent three weeks redesigning the hardware interface to their system. My design will appear on their next-generation product.</p>
		
		<p class="BodyPara">A golf course irrigation system is usually managed by a central computer, but it is also served by 30 or 40 &#147;satellites&#148;: waist-high metal boxes that control the flow of water to as many as 100 sprinkler heads. The satellite faceplate offers controls for manually programming the irrigation.</p>
		
		<p class="BodyPara">Due to various technical, environmental and cost constraints, the interface hardware was extremely limited: push buttons, a knob, LEDs and a tiny 4 by 20 character LCD. On the lower right is Toro&#146;s initial mockup of their new faceplate. The number of buttons is overwhelming, and there's no clear logic to the control layout. </p>
		
		<p class="BodyPara">Our challenge was to minimize the button clutter while still providing quick access to the handful of tasks that are commonly performed on the satellite.</p>
		
		<p class="BodyPara">I grouped the cursor keys, knob and LCD together so that their relationship is clearer.  An irrigation technician can then manipulate the on-screen interface using both hands: the arrow keys move the cursor from field to field, while the knob changes the selected field&#146;s value.</p>
		
		<p class="BodyPara">The number of buttons was cut in half, and I worked with a visual designer to use color and layout to better organize the remaining ones.</p>
		
		<p class="BodyPara">Even more important than cleaning up the layout was simplifying the on-screen interface. By changing the interface options to conform more closely to the irrigation tech&#146;s mental model, I was able to give users more control with fewer button presses.</p>
