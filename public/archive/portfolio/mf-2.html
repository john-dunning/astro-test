      <p class="InitialPara"> One of the new features that I made sure got into 
        mTropolis 2.0 was the ability to run projects inside windows or floating 
        palettes, instead of as full screen presentations. When a project is run 
        inside the mTropolis editor, it has access to the contents of other open 
        projects. This gives an author the ability to create custom editor tools 
        that can, for example, automate repetitive tasks. It would also enable 
        mFactory to add new functionality without having to ship an updated version 
        of mTropolis.</p>
			
      <p class="BodyPara">I used this capability to write some plug-in tools that 
        were shipped with 2.0. One feature users often requested was the ability 
        to check the value of their variables while a project is running, which 
        is essential for debugging. </p>
			
      <p class="BodyPara">To satisfy this request I created the Object Watcher 
        tool. A user first selects the object or objects they want to keep track 
        of and then clicks the Add button on the tool&#146;s floating palette 
        window (simply dragging the items to the tool would have been a better 
        approach, but the plug-in tools weren&#146;t able to process a drag and 
        drop event). As the project runs, the variable&#146;s current value is 
        displayed next to its name in the list.</p>
			<p class="BodyPara">In addition to variables, graphical elements could also 
				be tracked. If an image isn&#146;t being displayed in a project, for instance, 
				the user could look at its attributes in the collapsible Details pane 
				and determine whether the element is invisible, off-screen, behind another 
				object, etc.</p>
			<p class="BodyPara">Another common request was a way to determine how much 
				memory a project was consuming. The Memory Watcher tool provides a simple 
				display of the amount of free memory in mTropolis, as well as the number 
				of individual elements and modifiers currently in RAM.</p>
