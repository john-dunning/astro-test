			<p class="InitialPara"> As an engineer at Apple I designed and implemented 
				a tool for developers of QuickDraw 3D accelerator cards. The app was written 
				in C++ and used the PowerPlant class library. </p>
			<p class="BodyPara">One of the difficulties of creating an accelerator card 
				is that QuickDraw 3D has a great many options and modes, all of which 
				must be tested in their various combinations. </p>
			
      <p class="BodyPara">My application, Sneak3view&nbsp;<a href="#Footnote">*</a>, 
        eases this task by enabling the user to adjust each of QuickDraw 3D&#146;s 
        settings and to then run a test that draws an image into two windows. 
        By comparing the output of an accelerator that is known to work (such 
        as Apple&#146;s) to their own, the user can more easily detect bugs in 
        their 3D card. </p>
			<p class="BodyPara">Sneak3view was successful enough to inspire at least 
				one company to state that they would support QuickDraw 3D on the PC if 
				we would port Sneak3view to Windows. </p>
			<p class="BodyPara">Besides Sneak3view, I wrote some sample 3D applications 
				that were distributed with the SDK. I also maintained a mailing list for 
				QD3D developers and responded to their questions.</p>
			<p class="BodyPara">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="BodyPara">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="Footnote"><a name="Footnote">*</a>&nbsp;Why the name Sneak3view? 
				The hardware abstraction layer between accelerator cards and QD3D that 
				eventually was called RAVE (for Rendering Acceleration something or other 
				(but really because RAVE sounded cool)) was originally called TinselTown. 
				A number of the associated tools and technologies had Hollywood-themed 
				names, so I suggested SneakPreview for the testing app. Someone else suggested 
				replacing &#147;Pre&#148; with &#147;3&#148;&#151;hence Sneak3view.</p>
