			A string-scoring and fuzzy-matching library. It's based on the algorithm
			used in the Quicksilver macOS utility and is designed for smart
			auto-complete. It improves on the original algorithm by tuning the scoring
			for long strings, such as webpage titles or URLs, so that the order of the
			results makes more sense for a given search string.
