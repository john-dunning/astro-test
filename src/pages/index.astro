			title="fwidgets"

		>
			A library for adding basic UI functionality to a Figma plugin without
			writing any UI code. Think of it like adding a series of interactive
			prompts to a command line tool, similar to the wizard structure of
			something like <code>create-react-app</code>. fwidgets lets you show one
			UI element at a time to the user, awaiting their input and then responding
			to it, while keeping all of your code in the main thread.

			title="quick-score"
			href="https://github.com/fwextensions/quick-score"
		>
			A string-scoring and fuzzy-matching library. It's based on the algorithm
			used in the Quicksilver macOS utility and is designed for smart
			auto-complete. It improves on the original algorithm by tuning the scoring
			for long strings, such as webpage titles or URLs, so that the order of the
			results makes more sense for a given search string.
